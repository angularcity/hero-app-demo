# Heroapp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.2.
This contains heroApp demo example from the base angulario site, and along with that, integrated the multilingual i18n internationalization and ion slider .

Steps for doing internationalization available at my site: http://www.angular-city.com/2017/06/i18n-with-angular-cli.html
